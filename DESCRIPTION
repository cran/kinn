Description: A graph based regression model from flat unstructured dataset.
             Each line in the input data set is treated as a node from which an edge to another line (node) can be formed.
             In the training process, a model is created which contains sparse graph adjacency matrix.
             This model is then used for prediction by taking a predictor and the model as inputs and outputs
             a prediction which is an average of the most similar node and its neighbours in the model graph.
